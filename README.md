# Exploring Application Usage Technical Interview

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This repository contains sample code from a past interview. It stems from a data challenge that provided data open to exploration with the main goal of finding insights and extracting some business value. I completed this work in only a few days with less than 14 hours of work spent on the analyses. This work was very highly commended and I wanted to share it to provide a resource for those engaging in technical interviews. 

This work is by no means perfect, and there are a number of areas where steps were taken for the sole purpose of exploration, but these materials have the potential to help those going through data interviews and can act as a developed example of a take-home technical interview. With this, the code here is to just act as a guide and should be viewed with a grain of salt. 

The data used in this code has been completely abstracted from the original dataset provided, and much of the data has been altered to make it a totally synthetic dataset. Due to the synthetic nature of the data in this shared example, many of the analyses will be different from what was seen with the actual data, and things may not make the most sense in context here. Please be aware of that while looking over the code and please only use this with the limitations in mind. 

Ultimately, sharing this code may be able to help those preparing for coding interviews, as well as being a demonstration of some of my own personal skill sets. **Please do not plagarize the materials here and please consider attribution if using this in your own work.**
